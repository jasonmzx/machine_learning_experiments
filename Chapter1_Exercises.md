Some exercises questions i've done from Chapter 1.) Exercises section of the book:
*Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow*

**What is a labeled training set? :**
- Dataset where every data entry includes another piece of data describing it.
- This kind of data is used in *Supervised Learning*.
-. It enables ML models to learn the characteristics associated with specific labels.

**2 Most Common Supervised Learning Tasks? :**
> 1.) Spam Classification
- Since it's either Spam or Not Spam (Spam or Ham as the cool kids say), it's easy to create datasets with various emails, along with their determined type (To be, or not to be spam)

>2.) Classification & Regression problems in general
- Since this kind of task is trained to spit out a very specific answer (It's a spam email for the example above, or It's the number 5, *MNIST*) Supervised Tasks thrive on Labelled Data, since this allows it to distinguish different data points, and preform regression techniques for modelling the problem, and where to draw the line between say a number *3* and an *8*.

**What is Un-Supervised Learning, and some common applications?:**
- Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets.
